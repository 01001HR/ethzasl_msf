Multiple fuzzy tracking states
extern templates c++11
cleanup rotations
Eigen::Map wrap Q-blocks (if possible)
Multiplication of F blockwise
Obs-constrainted EKF prediction
evaluate "short" covariance update formula

symm P: EV decompose P, set EVs<eps to zero and rebuild (profile this to know the cost!)

make sensor_manager provide interface to add measurement to core, so that 
measurements dont need to include the core, but just the base manager class. 

use more polymorphism to reduce compilation time and break up dependencies
