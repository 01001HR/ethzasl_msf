(very) simple guideline on how to run MSF from a Rosbag
Things marked in "[]" are only for testing purposes and are not required for the system to run
In "<>" are commands to type in console. Note that most commands have to be executed in a separate Console
since they are required to run.

1) Get enough Console Tabs :-)
2) Start a roscore service <roscore>
3) Tell ros to use simulation time <rosparam set /use_sim_time true>
4) Start playback of your rosbag file USE --clock option <rosbag play /path_to_your_rosbag --clock --pause>
5) Start MSF, Rovio and other nodes needed using a launch file. You can find a sample launch file under msf_updates/launch/sample_launch.launch <roslaunch msf_updates your_launchfile.launch
6) Unpause your rosbag playback (using "space") until MSF recieved at least one measurement from each sensor (it will generate an output once it did) and pause playback again
7) Start the dynamic reconfigure server and use the "init" service call <rosrun rqt_reconfigure rqt_reconfigure> in the window that opens go to your_sensor_name->position_pose_sensor and click on core_init_filter
[8) the msf_plotting_utility git (git@gitlab.ethz.ch:huberya/msf_plotting_utility.git) provides some plotting utility for results. To record a rosbag that can be used for the provided python scripts
use the record_all bash script <./record_all>]
[9) To plot topics while running use rqt_plot and subscribe to the topics <rosrun rqt_plot rqt_plot]
10) Unpause the rosbag playback. Now the system should run
